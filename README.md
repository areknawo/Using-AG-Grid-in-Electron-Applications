# Using AG Grid in Electron Applications

- [Electron Docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest)
- [AG Grid JavaScript Docs](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/)

## Requirements

- Node.js v12.13.0 or later
- NPM v7 or later
- NPM modules installed:

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run start
```

This starts your app in development mode, opening Electron app window and rebuilding renderer process' assets on file changes.

## Production

First, build app for your platform:

```sh
npm run make
```

Details on targeting other platforms and additional configuration available on [Electron Forge docs](https://www.electronforge.io/config/makers)
